## Reporting Bugs

Before opening a new issue, please [search existing issues](https://github.com/sup3rus3r/obsidian-anyagent/issues) to avoid duplicates.

When filing a bug report, include:

- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behavior** vs. **actual behavior**
- **Environment details**: OS, Python version, Node.js version, browser (if frontend)

- **Screenshots or recordings** if applicable

> **Do not include API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information in issues.**

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome. To suggest a new feature:

1. [Search existing issues](https://github.com/sup3rus3r/obsidian-anyagent/issues) to see if it has already been proposed.
2. Open a new issue with the label `enhancement`.
3. Describe the problem your feature solves and your proposed solution.
4. Provide any relevant examples, mockups, or references.

For large or breaking changes, please open an issue to discuss before submitting a PR — this avoids wasted effort if the direction doesn't align with the project roadmap.

## Branch & Commit Conventions

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features or enhancements |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes |
| `docs/` | Documentation-only changes |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring without behavior change |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, dependency updates, tooling |

Examples:
```
feature/hitl-approval-ui
fix/agent-cancellation-race
docs/vault-setup-guide
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
```
feat(orchestrator): enforce sequential depends_on for all agents
fix(executor): handle CancelledError separately from Exception
docs(readme): update Docker quickstart instructions
```

Keep the subject line under 72 characters. Use the body to explain *why*, not just *what*.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date** with `main` before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR. Avoid bundling unrelated changes.

3. **Test your changes** locally before submitting.

4. **Open the PR against `main`** with:
   - A clear title following the commit convention above
   - A description explaining **what** changed and **why**
   - References to any related issues (e.g., `Closes #42`)
   - Screenshots or recordings for UI changes

5. **Be responsive** to review feedback. If a review requests changes, address them or explain your reasoning.

6. All checks must pass before a PR can be merged.

## Code Style & Standards

### Python (Backend)

- **Formatter:** [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) — keep consistent with existing style
- **Type hints:** Use type annotations for all function signatures
- **Pydantic models:** Use for all request/response schemas
- **Async:** Prefer `async`/`await` patterns consistent with FastAPI conventions
- Do not commit unused imports or dead code

### TypeScript / JavaScript (Frontend)

- **Language:** TypeScript — avoid `any` types
- **Formatting:** Keep consistent with existing config
- **Components:** Functional React components with hooks
- **State management:** Follow existing Zustand store patterns
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes — avoid inline styles

### General

- Write self-documenting code; add comments only where the logic is not immediately obvious
- Keep functions small and focused
- Do not introduce new dependencies without prior discussion in an issue
